 <h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>

 <hr />
 <h3>Extra action</h3>
 <p>
    The movie grabbed my attention from the very first scene! It was never boring — full of excitement and nonstop action, and I didn’t even feel the time passing while watching it.<br />
 What got me hooked the most was how unpredictable the events were. There was always something unexpected happening, and that’s exactly the kind of movie I love — the kind that keeps me guessing and never lets me get bored or figure out the ending too soon.<br />
The characters were really well done and layered. You could feel that each one had their own story and purpose — they weren’t just there to fill scenes. Especially the main character — he came across as strong, but at the same time, he had this human side that made me connect with him emotionally.<br />
And the cinematography? Amazing! The camera angles and the way the action scenes were shot made me feel like I was right there in the middle of it all, not just watching from a distance. Even the music added to the experience — it built the tension and made everything feel more intense and exciting.<br />
<br />Honestly, I love movies that mix action with a bit of drama and emotion — not just explosions for the sake of it. And this movie nailed that balance perfectly. <br />

 <h3> Damsel</h3>
 <p>
    Honestly, I didn’t expect the movie to be this good. I thought it was going to be a typical princess story, but it turned out to be something completely different.<br />
 What really grabbed me was how the story flipped — the main character was on her way to get married, and suddenly everything changed. She ends up in this dark, dangerous place and has to survive on her own.<br />
I loved how the main character wasn’t weak at all. She was strong, smart, and brave. Even when she was scared and exhausted, she didn’t give up. I liked seeing her figure things out and fight her way through, especially when she faced the dragon all by herself. She wasn’t waiting for someone to save her — she saved herself.<br />
The scenes inside the cave were so intense. I felt like I was stuck in there with her — everything made me anxious and excited at the same time. Even the dragon looked scary in a really cool way.<br />
<br />What made me like the movie even more was the message behind it: girls don’t always have to be the weak ones or wait to be rescued. They can be strong and take control. And the main character showed that perfectly.<br />
 </p>

 <h3>Bird box</h3>
 <p>
    Bird Box really pulled me in from the start. The mystery and suspense were on another level.<br />
I liked how the movie didn’t explain everything right away — it kept me guessing the whole time. I was always wondering, what are they seeing? what’s causing all this? That made it super intense and kept me focused the whole way through.<br />
Sandra Bullock’s character was amazing. I loved how she stayed strong even when everything was falling apart. She had to survive, protect two kids, and make it through this crazy world — all while blindfolded! That part really got to me. Imagine having to do everything without seeing, while knowing one wrong move could cost your life.<br />
The way the story kept switching between the past and present made it even better. It helped me understand how things got so bad and what she had to go through to survive. And the river scene? That part had me holding my breath the whole time.<br />
<br />
What I liked most was the deeper meaning — it’s not just about surviving monsters, it’s about trust, motherhood, fear, and hope. Even when the world went dark, she kept going. And that made the ending feel really powerful.<br />
